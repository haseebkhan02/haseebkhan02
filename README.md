## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate AI/ML engineer with hands-on experience building **Generative AI models**, **Wi-Fi optimization systems**, and **real-time log analyzers**. With a strong foundation in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Embedded Networking**, I blend research and practical engineering to solve complex system-level problems.

Currently working at **Samsung Semiconductor India R&D**, I specialize in:
- 🌐 Wi-Fi network optimization using AI/ML
- 🤖 Log automation using NLP and anomaly detection
- 🧠 LLM-based assistants for Wi-Fi debugging and maintenance

I’ve also worked with **Nokia** on **5G MAC layer development** and mentored final-year students as an **Assistant Professor** in AI and Generative Models.
